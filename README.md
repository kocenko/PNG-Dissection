# PNG Dissection

## About the project

### Main goals
 - Create an app which will decode information from the header of the PNG file.
 - Visualize the file's attributes (such as the size, colour depth, sampling frequency) and the file itself.
 - Display a graph of the file transformed using Fourier Transform.
 - Suggest the way of testing the correctness of the transformation.
 - Implement the option to delete all unnecessary data to anonymise the file without interfering with the image.

### Additional extensions
